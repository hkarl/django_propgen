synopsis: Utilities for accessing and manipulating fields of records
description:
    In Haskell 98 the name of a record field
    is automatically also the name of a function which gets the value
    of the according field.
    E.g. if we have
    .
    data Pair a b = Pair
    first :: a, second :: b
    .
    then
    .
    > first  :: Pair a b -> a
    > second :: Pair a b -> b
    .
    However for setting or modifying a field value
    we need to use some syntactic sugar, which is often clumsy.
    .
    modifyFirst :: (a -> a) -> (Pair a b -> Pair a b)
    modifyFirst f r\@(Pair
    first=a
    ) = r
    first = f a
    .
    With this package you can define record field accessors
    which allow setting, getting and modifying values easily.
    The package clearly demonstrates the power of the functional approach:
    You can combine accessors of a record and sub-records,
    to make the access look like the fields of the sub-record belong to the main record.
    .
    Example:
    .
    > *Data.Accessor.Example> (first^:second^=10) (('b',7),"hallo")
    > (('b',10),"hallo")
    .
    You can easily manipulate record fields in a 'Control.Monad.State.State' monad,
    you can easily code 'Show' instances that use the Accessor syntax
    and you can parse binary streams into records.
    See @Data.Accessor.Example@ for demonstration of all features.
    .
    It would be great if in revised Haskell versions the names of record fields
    are automatically 'Data.Accessor.Accessor's
    rather than plain @get@ functions.
    For now, the package @data-accessor-template@ provides Template Haskell functions
    for automated generation of 'Data.Acesssor.Accessor's.
    See also the other @data-accessor@ packages
    that provide an Accessor interface to other data types.
    The package @enumset@ provides accessors to bit-packed records.
    .
    For similar packages see @lenses@ and @fclabel@.
    A related concept are editors
    <http://conal.net/blog/posts/semantic-editor-combinators/>.
    Editors only consist of a modify method
    (and @modify@ applied to a 'const' function is a @set@ function).
    This way, they can modify all function values of a function at once,
    whereas an accessor can only change a single function value,
    say, it can change @f 0 = 1@ to @f 0 = 2@.
    This way, editors can even change the type of a record or a function.
    An Arrow instance can be defined for editors,
    but for accessors only a Category instance is possible ('(.)' method).
    The reason is the @arr@ method of the @Arrow@ class,
    that conflicts with the two-way nature (set and get) of accessors.
